📌 Problem Statement

In many organizations, maintenance requests for equipment are still handled through manual processes such as verbal reporting, paper records, or unstructured digital messages. These methods are inefficient and often result in delayed responses, lack of accountability, poor tracking, and miscommunication between departments and maintenance teams.

There is no centralized system to record, monitor, and manage maintenance issues throughout their lifecycle. As a result, organizations face difficulties in tracking request status, prioritizing repairs, reducing equipment downtime, and maintaining transparency in maintenance operations.

To address these challenges, there is a need for a simple, user-friendly, and centralized maintenance request tracking system that allows users to raise requests easily and enables maintenance teams to manage and monitor request status efficiently in real time.
